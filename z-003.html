  <pre>Z-003:

    Class: Rift ◉
    
    Containment Procedures:
    
    Z-003 is contained in a hermetically sealed isolation chamber
    within the Biological Hazards Wing of Archive-ZER0.
    Atmosphere must remain sterile, oxygen-free, and under negative pressure at all times.
    Any corpse exposed to Z-003’s effects is to be immediately submerged in acid
    and incinerated to prevent post-mortem reanimation.
    Personnel entering the chamber must wear full biohazard suits with internal air supply.
    
    Description:
    
    Z-003 is an obsidian funerary mask dated to no known civilization. Surface composition
    appears mineral but behaves partially organic when under biological proximity.
    The interior pulses faintly with bioluminescent veins when within 1 m of a living organism.
    
    When worn, the mask fuses seamlessly to the user’s face,
      initiating complete regeneration of damaged tissue within minutes.
    Subjects experience extreme euphoria and claim to “see Heaven through their own eyes.”
    Audio recordings capture whispers of choral sounds during this phase — origin unknown.
    
    However, all test subjects perish within 15–20 minutes due to uncontrolled biological overgrowth 
    — duplication of internal organs and bone structures.
    Upon death, a black-green algal substance begins forming across the corpse within 3 hours.
    
    This substance — designated Z-003-α — spreads rapidly, consuming tissue
    and reanimating the host in a low-cognitive, violent state.
    Infected entities display primitive coordination and respond aggressively
      to living organisms, often attempting to “feed” them fragments of the algae.

  <pre>
Log 1 — Initial Recovery

Date: 2025-09-18
Z-003 retrieved from beneath the ruins of ██████ Hospital, sealed in an iron reliquary bearing a faded sigil—identical to those cataloged in ███████████: Section ECHO-Φ.

Local witnesses reported “figures in beaked masks” walking through fog before collapsing.
All victims displayed doubled internal organs and black residue leaking from eye sockets.

During transport, personnel noted faint humming through respirators.
Audio analysis later revealed the frequency matched ███████████’s Codex Tone 3.

</pre><br><pre>
  Log 2 — Observation Session A

  Subject: Class-D-4510
  Procedure: Mask applied for 5 minutes.
  
  00:30 — Subject reports warmth and clarity of thought.
  02:12 — Minor wounds heal instantly.
  03:46 — Subject smiles, murmuring: “They’re walking in light. The doctors of Heaven.”
  05:20 — Mask fully fused. Vital signs spike; cardiac duplication detected.
  07:03 — Subject collapses; mask detaches on its own, surface dripping with black fluid.
  
  Corpse reanimated 3 h 21 m later. Entity attempted to approach containment glass, repeating:
  
  “The cure is within the breath.”
</pre><br><pre>
  Log 3 — Incident Δ-7

  Date: 2025-09-27
  A minor containment breach occurred when ventilation systems briefly reactivated.
  Z-007-α spores entered corridor 4-B; two staff contaminated.
  
  Both later found kneeling, whispering in unison:
  
  “The One Archive opened the gate.”
  
  Subsequent autopsies revealed the same sigil cluster burned beneath their lungs—identical
  to ███████████’s “Breath Seal” pattern.
</pre><br><pre>
  Log 4 — Observation Session B (Audio Fragment)

  Researcher: “What do you see?”
  D-4588: “A hall of masks. All looking down. They say the world is sick.”
  Researcher: “Who are they?”
  D-4588: “The Plague-Saints. They serve the First Healer… from ███████████.”
  (Signal distortion. Laughter, followed by choking sounds.)
  
  Entity terminated after reanimation. Chamber now permanently sealed.
</pre><br><pre>
Log 5 – Environmental Test
Date: 2025-10-05
Chamber subjected to temperature fluctuations. Minor condensation intensified perceived distortions. Staff reported reflections did not match reality.

████ may be connected to ██████ anomalies.
Addendum 003-Ω

Spectral scans of Z-003’s interior revealed a microscopic engraving under the left lens:

“THE BREATH SHALL RETURN TO ITS SOURCE.”

Cross-reference note from ███████████ Division Lead ECHO-4:

“If the algae breathes, and we breathe—then the infection was never meant to heal us. It was meant to collect us.”
