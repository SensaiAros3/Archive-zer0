<pre>Z-019

Object Class: Rift ◎

Containment Status: Restricted Auditory and Visual Monitoring

Containment Procedures:
Z-019 is contained in a soundproofed, windowless chamber with infrared cameras.
Personnel must remain seated and avoid sudden movements; stress-inducing stimuli are prohibited.
All recordings must be reviewed by Level 3+ personnel before release.

Description:
Z-019 manifests as fluctuating visual static with faint harmonic tones.
It appears responsive to observers’ emotional states, occasionally forming fleeting humanoid silhouettes.
Exposure over 10 minutes may induce mild auditory hallucinations, nausea, and emotional instability.

Backstory:
Discovered in 2022 within a decommissioned broadcasting facility.
Early personnel reported feeling watched through the static, and hearing fragmented phrases.
Containment implemented after repeated psychological strain in field teams.
