<pre>Z-014

Object Class: Eclipse ◎

Containment Status: Restricted Observation

Containment Procedures:
Z-014 is contained within a reinforced observation chamber.
Personnel must wear full sensory monitoring equipment and
log any anomalous experiences immediately. Interaction
requires approval from Level 3+ staff. The chamber is monitored
via multiple cameras and environmental sensors to ensure
no containment breach occurs.

Description:
Z-014 manifests unpredictable temporal and spatial fluctuations.
Observers report distortions in perceived time, such as brief
skipped intervals or repeated sequences. Physical objects may
shift slightly in position when unobserved, and light behaves
in inconsistent patterns within the chamber. While not overtly
dangerous, prolonged exposure can lead to cognitive disorientation
and subtle psychological effects.

Backstory:
Z-014 was discovered in 2019 following reports of “missing minutes”
in a remote research outpost. Initial investigation revealed a
localized spatial-temporal anomaly that seemed to manipulate
both the environment and observers’ perception of time. Archive-ZER0
personnel contained the anomaly after observing early effects
on electronic equipment and staff, including memory lapses
and temporal echoing. The anomaly remains under observation
for potential long-term studies of time-space interactions.

Log 4 – Containment Review
Date: 2021-01-05
Personnel Involved: Team Delta
Summary:
Containment chamber sensors noted shifting object positions when unobserved. Field reinforced for added stability.
