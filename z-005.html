  <pre>Z-005

    Object Class: Eclipse ◎
    Containment Procedures:
    
    Z-005 is contained within a secure, enclosed chamber, equipped with
    psychic dampeningtechnology to prevent its mental influence from spreading.
    All visitors must undergo a psychological screening before engaging with 
    the Mirage. Any individuals showing signs of psychic instability are immediately 
    removed from the area. Access to the Mirage’s interactive experiences is heavily
    restricted to prevent mental breakdowns or prolonged exposure.
    
    Description:
    The Mirage Construct is not a physical object but a sentient psychic projection
    capable of creating hyper-realistic illusions based on the deepest subconscious
    desires of those who encounter it. It manifests as a shifting, translucent shape 
    hat is ever-changing, reflecting its victims’ innermost fantasies and fears.
    
    Backstory:
    Discovered in 1972, the Mirage was found within the ruins of an unknown civilization
    in the Himalayan Mountains. The first team of explorers who encountered it were
    immediately pulled into an illusory world where their deepest desires were
    granted—only to have these dreams turn into nightmares.
    
    The object operates by latching onto an individual’s subconscious and presenting them
    with a version of reality tailored to their desires. However, as those who interacted
    with it soon discovered, the illusion is not real. The Mirage distorts the mind,
    trapping individuals in a perpetual cycle of illusionary happiness followed by despair,
    as they realize their perfect world is nothing more than a fleeting dream.

    Log 1 – Initial Containment
  Date: 1972-08-14
  Personnel Involved: Dr. ██████, Lt. Harada, Field Operative Team 4
  Summary:
  Z-005 was discovered in the ruins of a previously undocumented civilization in the Himalayas.
  Initial encounter reports indicate the object manifests as a translucent, constantly shifting
  shape. The first team experienced vivid hallucinations of personal desires, which quickly
  transitioned into nightmares. Psychological testing revealed acute dissociative reactions.

  Containment Measures Implemented:

  Z-005 transported to Archive-ZER0 in a specially designed, psychic-dampened containment chamber.

  Psychological screening protocols created for all personnel interacting with the Mirage.

  Chamber equipped with observation equipment to monitor both
  visual manifestations and mental strain on personnel.

  Note: Lt. Harada reported, “I saw a vision of my childhood home, but by the second minute, the
  walls were closing in… it felt alive, mocking me.”

  Log 2 – Observation Session 1
Date: 1972-09-01
Personnel Involved: Dr. ██████, Psychologist M. Tanaka
Summary:
First controlled interaction conducted with a level 2 staff member. Subject reported seeing a
“perfect reality,” reflecting personal desires. Subject became distressed upon realizing the
scenario was illusory. Immediate removal from the chamber prevented prolonged exposure.

Findings:

● The Mirage interacts directly with the subconscious, bypassing normal sensory perception.

● Illusions are hyper-realistic, indistinguishable from reality to the subject’s mind.

● Emotional impact is severe; prolonged exposure can lead to permanent dissociative states.

Recommendation: Limit exposure to under 5 minutes per session. Full debriefing required immediately after interaction.
