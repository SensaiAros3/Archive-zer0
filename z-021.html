<pre>Z-021

Object Class: Rift ◎

Containment Status: Restricted Temporal Observation

Containment Procedures:
Z-021 is contained in a reinforced chamber with time-stabilization fields.
Personnel must wear temporal anchors to prevent memory dissonance.
All interactions are logged and reviewed for psychological impact.

Description:
Z-021 manifests as interdimensional distortions visible as flickering light patterns.
It induces temporal dissonance, where observers perceive events out of chronological order.
Extended exposure may cause memory overlap and minor personality shifts.

Backstory:
Discovered in 2023 during a structural collapse at a research facility.
Teams reported seeing past and future events simultaneously.
Containment implemented with stabilizing fields and controlled observation protocols.
