    <pre>Z-010

Object Class: Rift ◇

Containment Status: Restricted Access (Knowledge Vault)

Containment Procedures:
Z-010 is secured in a controlled, magnetically shielded library room.
All entries are logged; personnel must wear memory stabilizers.
Books and objects are cataloged digitally before handling.

Description:
The Fractured Library consists of shelves containing books
that constantly rewrite themselves based on unknown knowledge streams.
Readers often experience temporary amnesia or sudden insights
unrelated to their previous understanding.

Backstory:
Discovered in a forgotten monastery in Romania in 2017, monks reported
books that altered their content overnight. Archive-ZER0 researchers
found that information absorbed by readers often appeared in future
editions of the books in unpredictable ways.
