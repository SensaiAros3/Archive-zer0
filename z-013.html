    <pre>Z-013

Object Class: Eclipse ◎

Containment Status: Restricted Auditory Observation (Soundproof Chamber)

Containment Procedures:
Z-013 is contained in a soundproofed chamber with vibration dampeners.
Observers must wear auditory isolation equipment.
Unauthorized vocalization near the chamber is prohibited.

Description:
The Silent Choir emits inaudible harmonic vibrations that influence
emotions and thought patterns. Exposure can cause uncontrollable
emotional responses and altered decision-making.

Backstory:
Discovered in 2021 in an abandoned cathedral in Prague, the Choir’s effects
were noted when visitors felt inexplicable sadness or euphoria
without hearing any sound. Archive-ZER0 established containment to prevent
psychological contamination.
