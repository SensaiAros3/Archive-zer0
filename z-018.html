<pre>Z-018

Object Class: Eclipse ◎

Containment Status: Restricted Visual and Spatial Observation

Containment Procedures:
Z-018 is contained within a reinforced low-light chamber equipped with motion and heat sensors.
Personnel must wear full sensory dampening suits. Observation is limited to two researchers at a time.
Any unauthorized movement triggers automated lockdown and fog-dispersal protocols.

Description:
Z-018 manifests as a semi-sentient mist reacting to the presence of living organisms.
It forms humanoid silhouettes that mimic gestures and posture. Prolonged exposure causes vertigo,
disorientation, mild hallucinations, and vivid recurring dreams. Cameras often fail to record consistent images.

Backstory:
Discovered in 2022 inside an abandoned mining facility. Early teams noted that the mist quickly imitated human behavior.
Psychological evaluations revealed compulsive behavior, transient amnesia, and spatial disorientation after exposure.
Containment protocols were established after near-incidents of severe psychological strain.
