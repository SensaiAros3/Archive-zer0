    <pre>Z-011

Object Class: Eclipse ◎

Containment Status: Controlled Access (Spatial Observation Zone)

Containment Procedures:
Z-011 is contained in a modular, sensor-laden corridor facility.
Personnel are monitored at all times; physical markers are used
to track displacement. Unsupervised navigation is prohibited.

Description:
The Endless Corridor appears to extend infinitely, folding space upon itself.
Distance perception is unreliable; traversing it can take days physically
while minutes pass outside. Disorientation and psychological strain are common.

Backstory:
First discovered in 2020 during a subterranean construction project
in Tokyo, Japan. Workers reported feeling trapped while the exit remained in
sight. Archive-ZER0 mapped the corridor and confirmed non-Euclidean properties.
