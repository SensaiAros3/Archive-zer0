    <pre>Z-012

Object Class: Rift ◇

Containment Status: Restricted Access (Botanical Chamber)

Containment Procedures:
Z-012 is housed in a hermetically sealed greenhouse.
Environmental controls maintain shifting seasonal cycles.
Personnel must wear protective clothing due to unpredictable flora behavior.

Description:
The Shifting Garden continuously rearranges itself,
changing plant positions, growth patterns, and environmental conditions.
Visitors report spatial disorientation and minor hallucinations of unknown flora.

Backstory:
Discovered in 2016 in the Amazon basin, explorers noted that paths
within the garden never repeated and plants moved subtly when unobserved.
Archive-ZER0 relocated the anomaly to a controlled chamber for study.
