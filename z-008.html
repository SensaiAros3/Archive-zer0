    <pre>Z-008

Object Class: Eclipse ◎

Containment Status: Restricted Display (Mirror Chamber)

Containment Procedures:
Z-008 is housed in a hermetically sealed mirror chamber with controlled lighting.
Observers must be monitored to prevent psychological destabilization.
All interactions require consent forms and daily mental health check-ins.
    
Description:
The Mirror of Forgotten Reflections shows a version of the observer
who has lost all personal memories and identity.
Repeated exposure can gradually erase autobiographical memory,
leaving only a sense of familiarity with others’ lives.
    
Backstory:
Discovered in an abandoned Venetian palace in 2020, the mirror was found in a
hidden study behind a collapsed wall. Artifacts suggested prior owners had left
detailed journals warning of memory loss and identity erosion.
