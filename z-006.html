  <pre>Z-006

    Object Class: Eclipse ◎

    Containment Status: Public Viewing (Temporal Anomaly Research)

    Containment Procedures:

    Z-006 is contained within a specialized time-stabilizing field to ensure that
    the surrounding timeline remains unaltered. Visitors and researchers must undergo
    thorough temporal training before interacting with the Timefract.
    A temporal anchor is used to keep individuals grounded in the present moment,
    preventing them from becoming lost in the fractured timelines. All interactions
    are strictly controlled, and any temporal distortions are immediately
    corrected by Archive-Zer0 personnel.
    
    Description:
    The Timefract appears as an interdimensional rift, where past, present,
    and future timelines collide in chaotic disarray. It is a tear in the
    fabric of time, pulling in individuals and events from multiple timelines,
    merging them into a singular, fractured reality. Those who encounter it are
    often overwhelmed by the experience of living multiple
    versions of their own lives simultaneously.
    
    Backstory:
    Z-006 was discovered in 2021 by the Galileo Probe, which detected an anomaly in
    the Kuiper Belt. The probe transmitted images of a rift in space-time that seemed to
    pull in everything around it. A temporal researcher, Dr. Victor Morningside,
    was the first to explore the rift in person. Upon entering, he found himself living
    multiple versions of his life, existing in alternate timelines where his
    actions played out in different ways.
    
    After exiting the rift, Dr. Morningside was unable to reconcile the memories of these
    different versions of himself. His journal describes endless variations of reality, creating a 
    paradox that threatened his very sense of identity. The Timefract continues to exist
    as a unstable temporal phenomenon, one that has the potential to collapse multiple timelines or
    erase entire historical events if not carefully contained.

    Log 1 – Initial Discovery
    Date: 2021‑03‑12
    Personnel Involved: Galileo Probe team, Dr. Victor Morningside
    Summary:

    The Timefract was first detected by the Galileo Probe in the Kuiper Belt.
    Images revealed a rift
    in space-time, drawing in nearby matter and light.
    Initial scans indicated chaotic temporal fluctuations.
    Dr. Morningside was the first human to approach the anomaly.

    Observations:

    Rift exhibited non-linear temporal distortions; time within the rift moved
    inconsistently relative to external observers.
    Probe sensors recorded overlapping images of past and potential future events.
    Dr. Morningside reported simultaneous memories of alternate life paths.
    Containment Measures:

    Immediate quarantine of the observation zone.
    Temporal stabilization fields drafted for future containment.
    Psychological evaluation protocols initiated for all personnel exposed.

    Note: Morningside’s initial report contains fragmented timestamps, suggesting the rift can
    “overlay” versions of reality onto itself.

  Log 2 – First Human Interaction
  Date: 2021‑04‑02
  Personnel Involved: Dr. Victor Morningside, Temporal Research Team Alpha
  Procedure: Controlled approach using temporal anchor and cognitive dampening equipment.
  
  Summary:
  Morningside entered the rift with safety measures engaged.
  He reported experiencing multiple versions of his life simultaneously:
  
  Alternate career paths.
  
  Varied personal relationships.
  
  Contradictory successes and failures occurring at once.
  
  Outcome:
  
  Subject exited rift physically unharmed but psychologically strained.
  
  Morningside’s journal revealed “temporal dissonance,”
  an inability to reconcile overlapping memories.
  
  Minor memory loss and dissociative episodes observed over the following week.
  
  Containment Note: Temporal anchor system successfully prevented
  loss of personnel to “timeline drift.”

  Log 3 – Incident Report Z‑006‑IR‑03
  Date: 2021‑05‑19
  Personnel Involved: Researcher L. Kim, Dr. Morningside
  Summary:
  Researcher Kim accidentally triggered the Timefract’s unstable rift expansion during calibration.
  
  ● Temporal echoes of future self appeared, providing contradictory instructions.
  
  ● Kim experienced partial temporal displacement; one hour perceived as multiple subjective years.
  
  ● Containment team successfully extracted the researcher using synchronized anchors.
  
  Consequences:
  
  ● Kim exhibits long-term temporal vertigo.
  
  ● Rift appears to have adapted to cognitive patterns of subjects; repeated
   exposure amplifies personal temporal dissonance.
  
  Protocol Update: Only Level 3+ personnel may approach the rift.
  Temporal anchors must be deployed in pairs for redundancy.

  Log 4 – Observation Session 7
  Date: 2022‑01‑14
  Personnel Involved: Temporal Research Team Beta
  Procedure: Monitoring Timefract with external observation drones only;
  no direct human interaction.
  
  Findings:
  
  ● Rift continues to pull temporal fragments from multiple nearby events.
  
  ● Minor temporal anomalies detected in adjacent archives: clocks running
  backward, files timestamped inconsistently.
  
  ● Spatial anomalies noted in the chamber; small objects exhibit temporal
  echoing (duplicated or phased in/out of present).
  
  Containment Recommendation:
  
  ● Increase stabilization field output.
  
  ● Limit direct human interaction until temporal ripple effects are fully mapped.

  Log 5 – Long-Term Containment Review
  Date: 2025‑08‑30
  Personnel Involved: Archive-ZER0 Council, Senior Temporal Analysts
  Summary:
  Four years of containment confirm:
  
  Z‑006 remains unstable; temporal fluctuations persist.
  
  Individual exposure leads to psychological strain;
  prolonged exposure risks permanent temporal dissociation.
  
  Temporal anchoring system prevents major timeline deviation within containment zone.
  
  Updated Protocols:
  
  Public viewing allowed only via virtual simulation, not direct interaction.
  
  Real-time temporal feedback sensors must be operational at all times.
  
  Any deviation in field stability triggers immediate emergency lockdown.
  
  Final Note: The Timefract is classified as Class 3 — Eclipse ◎,
  reflecting its potential for wide-scale psychological and temporal impact if containment fails.
