Z-007

Object Class: Eclipse ◎
Containment Status: Public Viewing (Temporal Anomaly Research)
Containment Procedures:
Z-007 is contained within a specialized time-stabilizing field to ensure that
the surrounding timeline remains unaltered. Visitors and researchers must undergo
thorough temporal training before interacting with the Timefract.
A temporal anchor is used to keep individuals grounded in the present moment,
preventing them from becoming lost in the fractured timelines. All interactions
are strictly controlled, and any temporal distortions are immediately
corrected by Archive-Zer0 personnel.

Description:
The Timefract appears as an interdimensional rift, where past, present,
and future timelines collide in chaotic disarray. It is a tear in the
fabric of time, pulling in individuals and events from multiple timelines,
merging them into a singular, fractured reality. Those who encounter it are
often overwhelmed by the experience of living multiple versions of their own lives simultaneously.

Backstory:
Z-007 was discovered in 2021 by the Galileo Probe, which detected an anomaly in
the Kuiper Belt. The probe transmitted images of a rift in space-time that seemed to
pull in everything around it. A temporal researcher, Dr. Victor Morningside,
was the first to explore the rift in person. Upon entering, he found himself living
multiple versions of his life, existing in alternate timelines where his actions played out in different ways.

After exiting the rift, Dr. Morningside was unable to reconcile the memories of these
different versions of himself. His journal describes endless variations of reality, creating a 
paradox that threatened his very sense of identity. The Timefract continues to exist
as a unstable temporal phenomenon, one that has the potential to collapse multiple timelines or
erase entire historical events if not carefully contained.

Z-008: The Reverse Mirror

Object Class: (Fill in based on your system)
Containment Status: Public Viewing (Psychological Phenomenon Display)
Containment Procedures:
Z-008 is kept in a secure chamber with multiple psychological monitors to track the emotional states of individuals viewing it. The Mirror is only allowed to be accessed in short, controlled bursts to prevent any severe psychological breakdowns. Mental health professionals are stationed nearby to assist any individuals who show signs of distress or disorientation. Prolonged exposure is strictly prohibited.

Description:
The Reverse Mirror is an ancient artifact that does not reflect a person’s true appearance but instead shows a twisted version of reality, reflecting a life defined by what could have been. It projects an alternate timeline where every decision made was reversed, showing the worst possible outcome.

Backstory:
The Reverse Mirror was uncovered in the ruins of a lost civilization in South America in the early 20th century. The first person to look into it, archaeologist Harold Fain, saw a reflection of himself living a life full of failure and regret, a stark contrast to his present. He became convinced that the reflection was his true self, not the life he had led.

Since then, those who have interacted with the Mirror have reported experiencing deep existential crises, as they come face to face with a version of themselves that never existed. The Mirror forces individuals to confront the regrets of their past, leaving them questioning the nature of their true selves and their choices.

Z-009: The Infinite Spiral

Object Class: (Fill in based on your system)
Containment Status: Public Viewing (Navigational Experience)
Containment Procedures:
Z-009 is contained within a psychic field to suppress its emotional and mental effects on individuals. Visitors must undergo a mental stability assessment before entering the experience. Guides are stationed throughout the Spiral’s virtual maze to ensure visitors do not become disoriented or lost in the psychological labyrinth. Only short, controlled experiences are allowed to prevent lasting trauma.

Description:
The Infinite Spiral is not a physical maze but a psychological construct, a labyrinth that exists in both physical space and the subconscious mind. Individuals who enter the Spiral are forced to confront their emotional landscape, navigating through paths that represent their fears, joys, and deepest regrets.

Backstory:
The Spiral was discovered in 1989 beneath the Arctic ice. The first psychological researcher to enter, Dr. Elena Cross, documented her experience of meeting alternate versions of herself, each embodying different emotional states. She wrote that the Spiral seemed to be an embodiment of human consciousness itself, a test of mental endurance and self-awareness.

As Dr. Cross delved deeper into the maze, she realized that the Spiral was not a simple structure—it was a mental journey, forcing participants to navigate their inner worlds. The experience was transformative, but it left many individuals emotionally scarred, unable to escape their own personal labyrinths of thought and emotion.

Z-010: The Fractured Archive

Object Class: (Fill in based on your system)
Containment Status: Public Viewing (Data Collection Exhibit)
Containment Procedures:
Z-010 is stored in a highly secure data vault with constant access monitoring. Researchers access the Archive through secure terminals that prevent the data from being altered or corrupted. Visitors are only allowed to interact with the fragments of lost knowledge under supervised conditions to prevent any mental disorientation or damage to the records. The Archive’s full potential is closely guarded due to the dangerous truths it may uncover.

Description:
The Fractured Archive is a mysterious data collection containing pieces of history that have been erased from existence. It is a chaotic amalgamation of fragmented records, lost timelines, and distorted events. The Archive is often described as a disjointed puzzle, each piece containing hints of a history that no longer exists.

Backstory:
The Fractured Archive was discovered in 2025 following a series of unexplained signals from a secret underground facility in Europe. The Archive’s records appear to contain glimpses of forgotten history, including civilizations that never existed, events that were erased, and individuals who never lived. The purpose of the Archive remains a mystery. Some theorize that it was created by an ancient civilization to erase dangerous truths, while others believe it was the result of temporal manipulation.

The Archive’s contents continue to puzzle researchers, with many believing it holds the key to understanding lost aspects of reality—though it also presents a grave risk, as its fractured nature can drive individuals to madness.
