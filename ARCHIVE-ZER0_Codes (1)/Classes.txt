Class 0 — Paperweight ☐

Meaning: Safe or inert anomaly. Low risk; useful or inertified.
Containment complexity: Minimal — standard storage, paperwork, periodic checks.
Team: Archivist + 1 tech. No special PPE.
Examples/hooks: Repaired clocks that run a minute slow; a toy that hums but causes no harm.
Usage note: Often used for training and public-facing decoys; still document thoroughly.

Class 1 — Veil ▣

Meaning: Containable but exposure is dangerous. The main threat is discovery/public knowledge (memetic/visual/aesthetic risk).
Containment complexity: Moderate — sensory barriers, restricted access, redacted logs.
Team: Researcher + Security liaison; Ethics review required for experiments.
Examples/hooks: Objects that manifest only on analog film; small creatures that induce nostalgia.
Escalation triggers: Unauthorized recording, civilian exposure, media leak.

Class 2 — Rift ◉

Meaning: Actively hazardous to individuals; unpredictable behavior; can injure/kill if mishandled.
Containment complexity: High — reinforced containment, active countermeasures, rotation of staff.
Team: Containment squad + Medical tech + Senior researcher.
Examples/hooks: Humanoid predators that exploit silence, creatures that damage sensory organs.
Escalation triggers: Containment breach, memetic bleed, prolonged exposure to personnel.

Class 3 — Eclipse ◎

Meaning: Significant public threat or resource sink. Can affect groups/communities and degrade infrastructure or cognition.
Containment complexity: Intensive — continuous monitoring, redundant fail-safes, area quarantine.
Team: Multi-disciplinary task force (military, senior scientists, legal/ethics).
Examples/hooks: Broadcast-borne anomalies, objects that rewrite short memories, localized reality shifts.
Escalation triggers: Cross-medium propagation (radio → phone → net), sustained mass exposure.

Class 4 — Cataclysm ☼

Meaning: Widespread or cascading threat. Containment may require sacrifice of resources, infrastructure shutdowns, or temporary evacuation of zones.
Containment complexity: Extreme — national level coordination, black site containment, memetic dampers.
Team: High command (Archive Council), military command, external liaison with governments.
Examples/hooks: Anomalies that can overwrite records at scale, flora/fauna that terraform regions, contagious cognitohazards.
Escalation triggers: Infrastructure co-option, geopolitical detection, cascading secondary anomalies.

Class 5 — Omega ⊗

Meaning: Apocalyptic / irreversibly reality altering. Cannot be reliably contained by current Archive means.
Containment complexity: Containment not guaranteed — focus on mitigation, obfuscation, and if possible, neutralization. Extreme secrecy.
Team: Emergency Archive Council + allied national/multinational assets; only a handful of personnel cleared.
Examples/hooks: Entities tied to 0MEGA, machine that “writes endings,” anomalies that unmake history.
Escalation triggers: Any perceptible shift in fundamental constants, mass causal inversion, or memetic pandemic.
