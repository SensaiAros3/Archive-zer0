  <pre>Z-001
Class: Veil▣

Containment: Lead-lined crate; view only through reflective liquid.
must be stored in a lightless chamber measuring no less than 5  x 5  x 3 .
Walls should be lined with non-reflective obsidian panels to minimize secondary reflections.

Description: A cracked hand mirror that doesn’t show anything, only memories of the Person looking at it


Behavior: Sometimes flashes faint numbers in the corner of the reflection.

  <pre>
    Log 1 – Initial Containment
Date: 2025-10-01
Z-001 was retrieved from ██████. The subject exhibits anomalous properties that cannot be fully measured.
Containment chamber prepared with reinforced mirror-glass walls.
Subject has not displayed hostile behavior but shows high responsiveness to observation.

Note: ██ staff reported “unusual sensation” near chamber.

</pre><br><pre>
    Log 2 – Observation Session 1
Date: 2025-10-02
Z-001 exposed to light and sound stimuli. Minimal reaction observed; however, reflections showed slight distortions.
██ researchers reported temporary disorientation.</pre>


<pre>
    3 – Security Incident 1
Date: 2025-10-03
Junior researcher entered chamber. Heard voices from Z-001 despite no sound sources. Subject remained motionless. Containment intact.

Footage reviewed: ██ seconds missing from camera feed.
</pre><br><pre>
    Log 4 – Psychological Evaluation
Date: 2025-10-04
Attempts to communicate failed. Research suggests subject may comprehend ██-dimensional or abstract stimuli.

Interview notes heavily redacted for ██ security reasons.
</pre><br><pre>
    Log 5 – Environmental Test
Date: 2025-10-05
Chamber subjected to temperature fluctuations. Minor condensation intensified perceived distortions. Staff reported reflections did not match reality.

████ may be connected to ██████ anomalies.
</pre><br><pre>
    Log 6 – Researcher Anomaly Report
Date: 2025-10-06
Two researchers reported seeing personal reflections that did not match their actions (altered facial expressions, gestures).
Psychological impact minimal, but follow-up recommended.

████ restricted.
</pre><br><pre>
Log 7 – Experiment: Object Interaction
Date: 2025-10-07
Objects placed inside Z-001’s chamber, including metallic spheres and digital displays.
Certain items returned altered; color saturation increased or textures seemed slightly… off.

Observation notes partially redacted: ██████.
Z-001 appeared to interact with ██████ not contained in this archive.
Researchers noted fleeting impressions of ██████ beyond recorded parameters.
</pre><br><pre>
Log 8 – Night Shift Observation
Date: 2025-10-08
Automated cameras recorded Z-001 motionless for 7 hours. Flashes on reflective surfaces noted. No sounds detected.

██ footage frames corrupted; cause unknown.
</pre><br><pre>
Log 9 – Containment Breach Drill
Date: 2025-10-09
Simulated breach conducted. Z-001 remained confined. Mirror-glass walls exhibited faint ripples. Drill deemed inconclusive.

Drill logs redacted: ██████.
</pre><br><pre>
Log 10 – Incident: Researcher Fatigue
Date: 2025-10-10
Staff reported headaches, vertigo, and fatigue near chamber. Symptoms dissipated away from Z-001.

██ incident linked to ██████ exposure.
</pre><br><pre>
Log 11 – Experiment: Light Refraction
Date: 2025-10-11
Laser grids and prism tests conducted. Z-001 reflections displayed impossible geometries.

██ measurements could not be recorded; equipment malfunction suspected.
</pre><br><pre>
Log 12 – Anomalous Observation
Date: 2025-10-12
During routine cleaning, Z-001’s reflection observed performing actions researcher did not perform.
No breach detected.

██ footage reviewed: anomalies partially censored.
</pre><br><pre>
Log 13 – Containment Review
Date: 2025-10-13
All systems operational. Staff advised rotation to minimize exposure effects. Z-001 fully contained.

██ notes marked for permanent redaction.</pre>
