    <pre>Z-009

Object Class: Eclipse ◎

Containment Status: Restricted Observation (Luminal Chamber)

Containment Procedures:
Z-009 is contained within a pitch-black chamber with no reflective surfaces.
Observers must wear insulated visual and auditory equipment.
Direct exposure to emitted light patterns is prohibited without protective filters.

Description:
The Luminous Echo is a floating sphere of radiant light that repeats
the emotional state of any observer in visual pulses.
Extended observation causes hallucinations of past traumas and memories.

Backstory:
Discovered in the depths of a cave system in Iceland in 2019, explorers
reported synchronized flashes that mirrored fear, elation, or sorrow.
Repeated exposure to the sphere induced vivid recollections and emotional
overload, necessitating containment by Archive-ZER0.
