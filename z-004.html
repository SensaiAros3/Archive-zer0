  <pre>Z-004

    Object Class: Rift ◉
    
    Containment Procedures:
    Z-004 is displayed in a secure, temperature-controlled chamber at Archive-ZER0,
    with constant surveillance and monitoring of visitors.
    The Vault is sealed within a psychic containment field to prevent its
    influence from reaching beyond its immediate area.
    Interaction with the Vault is restricted to individuals who undergo thorough psychological
    evaluations and sign a consent waiver acknowledging the potential dangers of exposure.
    
    Description:
    The Eternal Memory Vault appears as an ancient,
    metallic structure buried beneath the sands of the Karakum Desert.
    Its exterior is covered in strange, unreadable markings,
    and it hums with a low,almost imperceptible frequency.
    The Vault is not merely a container but a sentient entity,
    containing the memories of all beings across the universe.
    
    Backstory:
    The Vault was discovered in 1967 during an archaeological expedition to the ruins of an
    ancient civilization, long forgotten by history.
    Researchers found the Vault buried in the desert beneath ruins,
    which contained no remnants of civilization.
    Instead, they unearthed a device that, upon activation,
    began to emit a powerful psychic field capable of linking minds to a collective memory bank.
    
    Dr. Lucille Hargrove, the first person to interact with the Vault, began experiencing entire
    alternate lifetimes, living the lives of others from parallel timelines.
    These experiences slowly eroded her sense of self, causing her to enter a catatonic state after
    seeing memories of herself living countless, contradictory lives.
    
    The Vault continues to interact with visitors, reshaping their memories and presenting them with
    lives they never lived.
    Though it offers fascinating insights into the nature of consciousness and reality,
    the Vault’s influence has led to severe psychological trauma for several subjects.
