<pre>Z-020

Object Class: Eclipse ◎

Containment Status: Restricted Observation (Mirror Chamber)

Containment Procedures:
Z-020 is contained in a chamber lined with mirrored surfaces. Observers must wear visual filters to prevent direct eye contact.
Interaction with the mirrors is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to touch the glass triggers automatic lockdown.

Description:
Z-020 exhibits reflective properties that display environments slightly offset in time.
Observers report that mirrors anticipate actions, showing movements a few seconds before they occur.
Long-term exposure may cause memory distortion and spatial disorientation.

Backstory:
Discovered in 2022 during renovations in a historical building.
Early teams noted reflections that did not correspond to reality, predicting actions and gestures.
Containment initiated after a researcher vanished after prolonged observation.
