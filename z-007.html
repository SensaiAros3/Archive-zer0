    <pre>Z-007

Object Class: Rift ◇

Containment Status: Restricted Access

Containment Procedures:

Z-007 is stored in an acoustically isolated chamber to prevent leakage of its effects.
Personnel interacting with the Whispering Vault must use noise-canceling protective headsets
and follow a scripted verbal protocol. Any deviation from the protocol may trigger
uncontrolled memetic influence.
    
Description:
The Whispering Vault manifests as a small, nondescript container with faint vibrations.
When approached, it emits indistinct whispers that implant subtle compulsions,
forcing observers to carry out cryptic instructions.
    
Backstory:
Discovered in 2018 within an abandoned research bunker in Siberia, the Vault was initially
mistaken for an ordinary storage unit. Field agents reported hearing messages in their
native language instructing them to perform hazardous tasks. Investigation revealed that
the Vault records ambient thought patterns and converts them into audible memetic signals,
capable of influencing cognition and behavior.

Log 1 – Initial Discovery
Date: 2018‑11‑03
Personnel Involved: Field Agent R. Chen
Summary:
The Vault emitted whispers upon approach. Agent Chen experienced
compulsive urges to write messages in an unknown script.
Containment Measures:
Immediate isolation of the unit. Field agents instructed not to communicate
with anyone for 48 hours post-exposure.

Log 2 – Cognitive Analysis
Date: 2019‑01‑12
Personnel Involved: Dr. S. Alverton
Procedure: Exposure under controlled conditions with audio suppression.
Findings:
Subjects reported internalization of instructions without external speech.
Vault appears to adapt its whispers to each observer's subconscious biases.
Containment Recommendations:
Continue isolation. Use protective headsets for all personnel interactions.

Log 3 – Incident Report Z-007-IR-03
Date: 2019‑06‑07
Personnel Involved: Research Team Gamma
Summary:
A team member accidentally removed the noise-canceling headset,
leading to uncontrolled whispers propagating through the containment wing.
Containment reinforced with soundproofing measures and memetic dampeners.
