<pre>Z-022

Class: Veil ▣

Containment Status: Acoustic Containment Dome

Containment Procedures:
Z-022 is confined within a subterranean soundproof chamber. 
Entry requires auditory filters and non-verbal communication protocols.
No external recording devices permitted within 50 meters.

Description:
Z-022 manifests as resonant vocal frequencies that mimic human tones.
Exposure induces synchronized emotional states across subjects.
Long-term exposure leads to cognitive blending and loss of individuality.

Backstory:
First detected in an abandoned subway in 2024 after reports of “collective humming.”
Resonance patterns indicated intelligent modulation.
Containment established with multi-layer soundproofing and frequency dampeners.
